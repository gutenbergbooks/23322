THE THREE BEARS.</h1>


<p class="cap">THERE were once three bears, who lived in a wood,<br />
Their porridge was thick, and their chairs and beds good.<br />
The biggest bear, Bruin, was surly and rough;<br />
His wife, Mrs. Bruin, was called Mammy Muff.<br />
Their son, Tiny-cub, was like Dame Goose&#8217;s lad;<br />
He was not very good, nor yet very bad.<br />
Now Bruin, the biggest&#8212;the surly old bear&#8212;<br />
Had a great granite bowl, and a cast-iron chair.<br />
Mammy Muffs bowl and chair you would no doubt prefer&#8212;<br />
They were both made of brick-bats, but both suited her.<br />
Young Tiny-cub&#8217;s bowl, chair, and bed were the best,&#8212;<br />
This, big bears and baby bears freely confessed.<br />
Mr. B&#8212;&#8212;, with his wife and his son, went one day<br />
To take a short stroll, and a visit to pay.<br />
He left the door open, &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;no doubt<br />
If our friend should call in, he will find us all out.&#8221;<br />
It was only two miles from dark Hazel-nut Wood,<br />
In which the great house of the three Bruins stood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>That there lived a young miss, daring, funny, and fair,<br />
And from having bright curls, she was called Goldenhair.<br />
She had roamed through the wood to see what she could see,<br />
And she saw going walking the Bruins all three.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE BEAR, WITH HIS WIFE AND SON, TAKES A WALK.</span>
</div>

<p>Said she to herself, &#8220;To rob bears is no sin;<br />
The three bears have gone out, so I think I&#8217;ll go in.&#8221;<br />
She entered their parlor, and she saw a great bowl,<br />
And in it a spoon like a hair-cutter&#8217;s pole.<br />
&#8220;That porridge,&#8221; said she &#8220;may stay long enough there,<br />
It tastes like the food of the surly old bear,&#8221;<br />
She tried Mammy Muff&#8217;s, and she said, &#8220;Mrs. B&#8212;&#8212;,<br />
I think your taste and my taste will never agree.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">GOLDENHAIR EATS UP TINY-CUB&#8217;S PORRIDGE.</span>
</div>

<p>Then she tried Tiny-Cub&#8217;s bowl, and said, &#8220;This is nice;<br />
I will put in some salt, and of bread a thick slice.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-9.jpg" width="500" height="559" alt="GOLDENHAIR BREAKS THE BOTTOM OUT OF TINY-CUB&#8217;S CHAIR." title="" />
<span class="caption">GOLDENHAIR BREAKS THE BOTTOM OUT OF TINY-CUB&#8217;S CHAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>The porridge she eat soon made her so great,<br />
The chair that she sat on broke down with her weight;<br />
The bottom fell out, and she cried in dismay,<br />
&#8220;This is Tiny-cub&#8217;s chair, and oh, what will he say?<br />
His papa is, I know, the most savage of bears,&#8212;<br />
His mamma is a fury; but for her who cares?<br />
I&#8217;m sure I do not; and then, as for her son,<br />
That young bear, Tiny-cub&#8212;from him shall I run?<br />
No, not I, indeed; but I will not sit here&#8212;<br />
I shall next break the floor through&#8212;that&#8217;s what I most fear;&#8221;<br />
So up-stairs she ran, and there three beds she found<br />
She looked under each one, and she looked all around;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>But no one she saw, so she got into bed&#8212;<br />
It was surly old Bruin&#8217;s, and well stuffed with lead.<br />
Mammy Muffs next she tried; it was stuffed with round stones,<br />
So she got into Tiny-cub&#8217;s and rested her bones.<br />
Goldenhair was asleep when the three bears came in.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BEARS COME HOME AND FIND THEIR PORRIDGE ALL GONE.</span>
</div>

<p>Said Big Bruin, &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8212;to eat, let&#8217;s begin&#8212;<br />
<span class="smcap">Who has been to my porridge?</span>&#8221; he roared with such might;<br />
His voice was like wind down the chimney at night.<br />
"<span class="smcap">Who has been to my porridge?</span>&#8221; growled out Mrs. B&#8212;&#8212;;<br />
Her voice was like cats fighting up in a tree.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been to my porridge and eaten it all?</span>&#8221;<br />
Young Tiny-cub said, in a voice very small,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been sitting in my great arm chair?</span>&#8221;<br />
In voice like a thunder-storm, roared the big bear.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been sitting in my good arm chair?</span>&#8221;<br />
Growled out Mammy Muff, like a sow in despair.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has sat in my nice chair, and broken it down?</span>&#8221;<br />
Young Tiny-cub said, and so fierce was his frown,<br />
That his mother with pride to his father said, &#8220;There!<br />
See our pet Tiny-cub can look just like a bear,&#8221;<br />
So roaring, and growling, and frowning, the bears,<br />
One after the other, came running up-stairs.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BEARS FIND GOLDENHAIR ASLEEP IN TINY-CUB&#8217;S BED.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been upon my bed?</span>&#8221; old Bruin roared out,<br />
In a voice just like rain down a large water-spout.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been upon my bed?</span>&#8221; growled out Mammy Muff,<br />
In a voice like her husband&#8217;s, but not quite so rough.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>"<span class="smcap">Who is lying on my bed?</span>&#8221; said young Tiny-Cub,<br />
In a voice like hot water poured into a tub.<br />
And Tiny-cub&#8217;s breath was so hot as he spoke,<br />
That Goldenhair dreamt of hot water, and woke.<br />
She opened her eyes, and she saw the three bears,<br />
And said, &#8220;Let me go, please, I&#8217;ll soon run down stairs.&#8221;<br />
But big Bruin was angry, and shouted out, &#8220;No!<br />
You had no right to come hither, and now you shan&#8217;t go.<br />
What we mean to do with you, ere long you shall find;<br />
You can lie there and cry till I make up my mind.&#8221;<br />
To Mammy and Tiny then did big Bruin roar,<br />
&#8220;Go and block up the chimney and nail up the door;<br />
This Goldenhair now has got into a scrape,<br />
And if I can help it, she shall not escape.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">GOLDENHAIR JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW.</span>
</div>

<p>But Goldenhair saw that a window was there,<br />
(It was always kept open to let in fresh air),<br />
So she jumped out of bed&#8212;to the window she ran,<br />
Saying &#8220;Three bears, good-bye! Catch me now if you can!&#8221;<br />
To the window the bears ran as fast as they could,<br />
But Goldenhair flew like the wind through the wood.<br />
She said the bears&#8217; breath had filled her with steam,<br />
But when she grew older she said &#8217;twas a dream,<br />
And no doubt she was right to take such a view;<br />
Still, some part of the story is certainly true,<br />
For unto this day there is no one who dares,<br />
To say that there never existed <span class="smcap">THREE BEARS</span>.</p>
